- remove suggestions on input focus

- next turn message - and on new round messages


- delay start of game so joiner has host name when alert shows
- delay new round message
- maybe a general delay between states


- new round starter logic (who starts that round?)
-- both states will be at NEW_ROUND which doesnt' say much (infer from last?)
